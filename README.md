# Autocomplete

This is the sample repository to my blog post on building a simple but powerful
autocomplete using [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine).

## Up & Running

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
